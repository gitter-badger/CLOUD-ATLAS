# COMMUNITY CHALLENGE

If you have sparetime for coding the six pinned repositories on https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/, i promise you get

- A collective computer. The more users the Cloud Atlas has, the better the overall life quality.

- A universal library with gaps but options to fill the gaps and connect the dots. Interdisciplinary. The more users the library has, the better the information quality.

- A social network for good deeds in every area from private to private or private to business or vice versa and around. The more users the social network has, the better the improvement rate.

- An interactive P2P TV Channel, showing people become famous with doing good deeds. The more users watching, the better the streaming quality.

- True P2P back-end for your next startup business idea, up and running in 60min at no cost. The more users your app has, the better the network quality.

- A distributed, global map tile server, for free access to a map tile API for Your next location based application. The more users using maps, the better the zoom in speed and the updates of maps.

- Nonprofitasaservice, pushing you to transform your idea into a non-profit business, which doesnt mean you cant do profit... (strong misconception about non-profit. Just the purpose is different, but not the methods. Of course you are allowed to make a profit, but for the good.) The more users your business has, the better the network quality.

- A “currency” that is based on a valueless unit-system, just like in the movies. Sustainability built in. Starting with solving world hunger. The more users the app has, the better the food distribution. (more disribution channels to come)

# Features 02.01.2022 stable <a href="https://cloud-atlas.app" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a> (Google login only)

## - Progressive Web App
A !website! which runs like a full installed application on any browser ergo any device, can be installed like an app, and is able to get uploaded to all three stores.

And all from the same codebase which is HTML, CSS, Javascript(typescript), React and Material-UI
<br>

## - Cesium Globe
A digital twin of the real world. Exactly like Google Earth but open-source, with a hugh potential for literally everything.
And I repeat myself saying: "why didn't Google ever did it?"

# Upcoming features:

## Season 1 (gets coded by a small team already)

### – ‘Social Time’ (local and global volunteering opportunities)
### – ‘Competence Community’ (Online and VR Brainstormings)
### – ‘P2P for Good’ (Peer-2-peer organized volunteering opportunities)
### – ‘Petitions for Good’ (Solution Oriented Online Petitions)
### – ‘Crowdfund for Good’ (Solution Based Crowdfundings)
### – ‘Mission TV’ (Live streamings of ‘Social Time’, ‘P2P for Good’ and successfully finished ‘Crowdfund for Good’ campaigns with donation options and integrated live-chat, so that viewers become a part of the show…)
<br><br>

### In Season 2, which will be running parallel in the background to Season 1, we will gamify the colonizing of the Cloud.Atlas with animated Wikipedia articles for the users and let the articles interact with each other and the users. Also in parallel, we will expand the 3D globe to a map of the known universe in Season 3.

### Starting from Season 4, we will ad a new set of features to become an incubator, accelerator and marketplace for Sustainable and Circular Economy Products only.

### If successful, from Season 5 we will start our own Internet of Things for Sustainable and Circular Economy Products only and work our way, community-developed as always, up to Season 6, where we introduce the Resource-based Economy concept and start dropping our surpluses into a financial asset to pay out everyone in need a global Unconditional Basic Income and hope to become a role model for other companies to follow our example, giving something back to the people who made their successes actually possible.

### In turn, the more successful Missions, Petitions, Crowd-fundings, Livestreamings, Sustainable and Circular Economy Products and successfully reached SDG Goals, the more Unconditional Basic Income everyone will get. (a bit like in a game, the more you play, the more you get...)

### Season 7 to Season 9 is not decided yet, but it’s about working backwards, putting the user even more into our center of the view.
### Season 10 will be all about the finalization of the artificial general intelligence.
