# Features 02.01.2022 stable <a href="https://cloud-atlas.app" target="_blank">LIVE DEMO</a> (Google login only)

## - Progressive Web App
A !website! which runs like a full installed application on any browser ergo any device, can be installed like an app, and is able to get uploaded to all three stores.

And all from the same codebase which is HTML, CSS, Javascript(typescript), React and Material-UI
<br>

## - Cesium Globe
A digital twin of the real world. Exactly like Google Earth but open-source, with a hugh potential for literally everything.
And I repeat myself saying: "why didn't Google ever did it?"

# Upcoming features:

## Season 1

### – ‘Social Time’ (local and global volunteering opportunities)
### – ‘Competence Community’ (Online and VR Brainstormings)
### – ‘P2P for Good’ (Peer-2-peer organized volunteering opportunities)
### – ‘Petitions for Good’ (Solution Oriented Online Petitions)
### – ‘Crowdfund for Good’ (Solution Based Crowdfundings)
### – ‘Mission TV’ (Live streamings of ‘Social Time’, ‘P2P for Good’ and successfully finished ‘Crowdfund for Good’ campaigns with donation options and integrated live-chat, so that viewers become a part of the show…)

### In Season 2, which will be running parallel in the background to Season 1, we will gamify the colonizing of the Cloud.Atlas with animated Wikipedia articles for the users and let the articles interact with each other and the users. Also in parallel, we will expand the 3D globe to a map of the known universe in Season 3.

### Starting from Season 4, we will ad a new set of features to become an incubator, accelerator and marketplace for Sustainable and Circular Economy Products only.

### If successful, from Season 5 we will start our own Internet of Things for Sustainable and Circular Economy Products only and work our way, community-developed as always, up to Season 6, where we introduce the Resource-based Economy concept and start dropping our surpluses into a financial asset to pay out everyone in need a global Unconditional Basic Income and hope to become a role model for other companies to follow our example, giving something back to the people who made their successes actually possible.

### In turn, the more successful Missions, Petitions, Crowd-fundings, Livestreamings, Sustainable and Circular Economy Products and successfully reached SDG Goals, the more Unconditional Basic Income everyone will get. (a bit like in a game, the more you play, the more you get...)

### Season 7 to Season 9 is not decided yet, but it’s about working backwards, putting the user even more into our center of the view.
### Season 10 will be all about the finalization of the artificial general intelligence.
